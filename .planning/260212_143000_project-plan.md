# Project Plan: skill-jira-management

Generated: 2026-02-12

## Board Stats

- 4 epics, 16 stories, 73 tasks
- Research: `.research/260212_jira-cloud-rest-api.md`

## Phase 1 (parallel — no dependencies)

### EPIC-260212-2f9q4y: jira-api-library (25 tasks)
Core Go library for Jira Cloud REST API.

| Story | Tasks | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| STORY-260212-307u15: http-client-and-auth | 4 | HTTP client, Basic Auth, request helpers |
| STORY-260212-sxqxdb: issues-crud | 6 | Create/Read/Update/List issues |
| STORY-260212-10abm1: projects-and-boards | 4 | List projects, boards, sprints |
| STORY-260212-1gnl9b: transitions-and-statuses | 4 | Get/execute transitions, list statuses |
| STORY-260212-c2q7sl: jql-search | 3 | JQL search with pagination |
| STORY-260212-31lihk: comments | 4 | Add/list comments, ADF formatting |

**Internal dep:** All stories depend on http-client-and-auth (foundation).

### EPIC-260212-20xgx3: config-and-auth (10 tasks)
Secure token storage + local config.

| Story | Tasks | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| STORY-260212-15csvr: secure-token-storage | 5 | Keychain/encrypted storage for API token |
| STORY-260212-31wd4j: local-config | 5 | Config YAML: project, board, locale |

**No cross-deps.** Can run fully parallel with jira-api-library.

---

## Phase 2 (blocked by Phase 1)

### EPIC-260212-1lc5rd: agents-facing-cli (23 + 1 = 24 tasks)
CLI tool `jira-mgmt` with agents-facing DSL.

| Story | Tasks | Blocked by |
|-------|-------|------------|
| STORY-260212-e6x8w8: cli-scaffold | 4 | http-client-and-auth, local-config |
| STORY-260212-37iagi: dsl-query-layer | 6 | issues-crud, projects-and-boards, transitions, jql-search |
| STORY-260212-2i2enj: scoped-grep | 3 | (internal only) |
| STORY-260212-cx2nw0: write-commands | 6 | issues-crud, transitions, comments |
| STORY-260212-1hhjyy: config-commands | 4+1 | secure-token-storage, local-config |

**Note:** TASK-260212-357oi1 (first-run-setup) is in config-commands.

---

## Phase 3 (blocked by Phase 2)

### EPIC-260212-y5iy2z: skill (14 tasks)
Claude Code / Codex skill.

| Story | Tasks | Blocked by |
|-------|-------|------------|
| STORY-260212-3mqvuv: skill-file | 4 | cli-scaffold, dsl-query-layer, write-commands |
| STORY-260212-2rdgwy: jql-patterns-reference | 7 | (none — can start earlier) |
| STORY-260212-1d76yl: skill-setup-and-symlinks | 3 | skill-file |

**Note:** jql-patterns-reference has no cross-deps, could start in Phase 1/2.

---

## Critical Path

```
config-and-auth → agents-facing-cli → skill
```

3 phases. jira-api-library runs parallel with config-and-auth in Phase 1.

## Agent Allocation (proposed)

| Phase | Agent | Scope |
|-------|-------|-------|
| 1 | agent-lib | EPIC: jira-api-library (all 6 stories) |
| 1 | agent-config | EPIC: config-and-auth (2 stories) |
| 1 | agent-jql-ref | STORY: jql-patterns-reference (can start early, no deps) |
| 2 | agent-cli | EPIC: agents-facing-cli (5 stories) |
| 3 | agent-skill | EPIC: skill (skill-file + setup) |

## Risks

- Jira ADF (Atlassian Document Format) complexity for comments/descriptions
- Search API migration: legacy `/search` removed, must use `/search/jql` with cursor pagination
- Custom field discovery for DoD (customfield_XXXXX IDs vary per instance)
